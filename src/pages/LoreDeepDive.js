            <h3 class="lore-section-header">The Trials</h3>

            <h4 class="lore-subheader">What Are the Trials?</h4>
            <p class="lore-p">
                In Dead by Daylight, the Trials are life-and-death games orchestrated by a cosmic, malevolent being known as The Entity. These Trials take place in various grim, surreal environments drawn from both the memories and experiences of its chosen victims. Each Trial pits four Survivors against a Killer, with the Survivors attempting to escape while the Killer hunts them down.
            </p>
            <h4 class="lore-subheader">Why Do the Trials Happen?</h4>
            <p class="lore-p">
                The Trials are essentially a form of worship for The Entity, which feeds on strong emotions—specifically hope and despair. By placing Survivors in terrifying scenarios where they are constantly teetering between escape and death, The Entity cultivates an endless cycle of emotional torment that sustains its existence. The stronger the emotions generated during the Trials, the more The Entity thrives.
            </p>
            <p class="lore-p">
                The Trials are not random; they are carefully orchestrated for the following reasons:
            </p>
            <p class="lore-p">
                Feeding on Fear: The Survivors' fear and despair during the Trials serve as nourishment for The Entity.
            </p>
            <p class="lore-p">
                Breaking Hope: While Survivors may feel hope when they escape or outsmart a Killer, this hope is ultimately crushed as they are returned to The Entity's grasp for another Trial, ensuring they can never truly escape.
            </p>
            <p class="lore-p">
                Testing and Corruption: The Trials act as tests for both the Survivors and Killers. The Entity often corrupts individuals (such as the Killers) to do its bidding, rewarding them for their loyalty with power while binding them eternally to its will.

            <h3 class="lore-section-header">About the Entity</h3>

            <h4 class="lore-subheader">What Is The Entity?</h4>
            <p class="lore-p">
                The Entity is a mysterious and otherworldly being that exists beyond human comprehension. It resides in a realm outside of time and space, referred to as The Entity's Realm, where it manipulates reality to create the environments and rules for its Trials.
            </p>

            <h4 class="lore-subheader">Nature and Purpose</h4>
            <p class="lore-p">
                The Entity's primary purpose is to feed on emotions—specifically, the juxtaposition of hope and despair. Its hunger drives all of its actions, from abducting Survivors and Killers to creating horrific landscapes. It is neither good nor evil in the human sense; it simply exists to sustain itself, much like a predator in nature.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="lore-section">
            <h3 class="lore-section-header">How Does It Operate?</h3>
            <h4 class="lore-subheader">Abduction and Corruption:</h4>
            <p class="lore-p">
                The Entity selects individuals from different timelines and realities, pulling them into its realm. 
                Survivors are often ordinary people with no prior connection to each other, while Killers are often individuals 
                with dark pasts who are more susceptible to The Entity's influence.
            </p>
            <p class="lore-p">
                The Entity manipulates Killers into its service, amplifying their violent tendencies and rewarding them with power 
                in exchange for their loyalty.
            </p>

            <h4 class="lore-subheader">Creation of the Trials:</h4>
            <p class="lore-p">
                The Entity crafts each Trial by pulling elements from the memories, fears, or defining moments of its victims. 
                For example, many Trial maps are based on significant locations from the Survivors' or Killers' pasts, 
                designed to evoke strong emotional reactions.
            </p>
            <p class="lore-p">
                The Entity sets rules for the Trials (e.g., the requirement to hook Survivors or power Exit Gates), 
                but these are ultimately arbitrary constructs meant to create a sense of struggle and futility.
            </p>

            <h4 class="lore-subheader">The Fog:</h4>
            <p class="lore-p">
                The Entity's realm is shrouded in a dense fog, which serves as both a physical manifestation of its influence 
                and a means of limiting visibility during the Trials. The fog also acts as a boundary, preventing escape 
                from its domain.
            </p>

            <h4 class="lore-subheader">Sacrifice to The Entity:</h4>
            <p class="lore-p">
                The ultimate goal for Killers is to hook Survivors, allowing The Entity to claim them. When a Survivor is hooked 
                three times or dies during the Trial, The Entity manifests to consume their essence. This "sacrifice" 
                is a direct offering that fuels The Entity's power.
